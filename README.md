# C\# Project Plan for theCoderSchool
## By Jarosław Rybak
### Project: Rock Paper Scissors
`Description:` Program a Rock Paper Scissors game that will be played in console.
-	The game must run infinitely until the user wants to exit, by typing Exit.
-	The game must check whether the input is correct (i.e., “ROCK”, “PAPER”, “SCISSORS” or “EXIT”) and respond accordingly.
-	The game must have a difficulty selector between the AI Behaviors at the beginning of the game.
-	Keep a score counter AI vs Player Name.
-	Save the Player Name and Score to a Score Board in a txt file

`Rules:`
-	Rock vs. Paper: Paper wins.
-	Paper vs. Scissors: Scissors wins.
-	Rock vs. Scissors: Rock wins.
-	Rock vs. Rock: No one wins.

`AI Behavior 1:` Randomly select between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

`AI Behavior 2:` Have AI select the option that will lose against the player’s previous choice.

`AI Behavior 3:` Invent your own AI behavior and implement it.

You may add more AI behaviors if you want to.

`Bonus:` You may look into a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and use it in your project after your project is completed.
